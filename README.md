# Welcome to cspy!
The Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Simulation made in python!

This project is an ongoing project i work on in my free time. This repository contains two branches:
  - master for files that work pretty much bug free
  - dev for files i am currently working on or which have major bugs concerning core functionality

In the end i plan on having:
  - a working, roundbased simulation of competitive matchmaking using different AIs on different Skill Levels ("Ranks")
  - multiple hardcoded maps
  - a somewhat functioning combat system
  - more knowledge about python in general

You can easily support me with this by commenting on the files i have commited, informing me about any bugs or better
methods i could be using with them, i would gladly appreciate this!

Note: This is my first repository and my first time using GitHub in generall.
